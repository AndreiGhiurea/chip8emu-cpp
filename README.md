# chip8emu-cpp

Yet another CHIP-8 Emulator written in C++.

Wrote this because I wanted to get into the emudev world.\
It has all instructions implemented, sans sound ofc.\
Will try to follow up with a NES emulator after I translate this one into Rust (cause I wanna learn Rust).

## Usage

```
chip8-emu.exe <rom-inage>
```

It uses keyboard rows from 1234 to ZXCV for the keypad.
